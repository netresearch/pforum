    Don't forget to save your record.

Create Forum Records
--------------------

It's your job to create some forum records where users can create topics and posts for. A forum record is
meant to be a category or discussion topic like "Let's talk about cars", "Sell and buy" or just simple
"Windows 11".

..  rst-class:: bignums

1.  Create storage

    Create a new page of type "Storage Folder" in pagetree.

2.  Create Forum record

    Switch to list module and chose your just created storage folder from pagetree. On the right frame click
    the `+` Button at the upper left. Search section `Forum` and click `Forum` from the list below to create a new
    forum record.

    Fill in values for title (required) and teaser. Do not add any teaser records. That's a job for your
    users in frontend.
