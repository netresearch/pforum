TypoScript
==========

`pforum` needs some basic TypoScript configuration. To do so you have to add an +ext template to either the root
page of your website or to a specific page which contains the `pforum` plugin.

..  rst-class:: bignums

1.  Locate page

    You have to decide where you want to insert the TypoScript template. Eithe root page or page with `pforum` plugin
    is OK.

2.  Create TypoScript template

    Switch to template module and choose the specific page from above in the pagetree. Choose
    `Click here to create an extension template` from the right frame. In the TYPO3 community it is also known as
    "+ext template".

3.  Add static template

    Choose `Info/Modify` from the upper selectbox and then click on `Edit the whole template record` button below
    the little table. On tab `Includes` locate the section `Include static (from extension)`. Use the search below
    `Available items` to search for `pforum`. Hopefully just one record is visible below. Choose it, to move that
    record to the left.

4.  Save

    If you want you can give that template a name on tab "General", save and close it.

5.  Constants Editor

    Choose `Constant Editor` from the upper selectbox.

6.  `pforum` constants

    Choose `PLUGIN.TX_PFORUM` from the category selectbox to show just `pforum` related constants

7.  Configure constants

    Adapt the constants to your needs.

8.  Configure TypoScript

    As constants will only allow modifiying a fixed selection of TypoScript you also switch to `Info/Modify` again
    and click on `Setup`. Here you have the possibility to configure all `pforum` related configuration.

Settings
========

Example: `plugin.tx_pforum.settings.auth = 2`

*   Value: `1`: No authentication. Everyone can create topics and posts. We prefer using it in intranet environments.
*   Value: `2`: An authenticated frontend user is needed to create topics and posts.

-------------------------

Default: 0

Example: `plugin.tx_pforum.settings.emailIsMandatory = 1`

If activated a further input field will be displayed where the user has to insert a valid email address.

and delete records in frontend view.

settings.uidOfUserGroup

------------------------
